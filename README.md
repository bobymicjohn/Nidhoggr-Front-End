# Nidhoggr-Front-End
Web based application for tracing of axons in high-res SEM brain scan images. 
Developed at the University of West Virginia Center for Neuroscience research labs. This is the front end of a semi-automated 3D
neuron modeling system, in which the user traces the axon in the first image in a stack images and then selects the center of the
axon in each successive image in the stack. A server-side back-end edge detection algorithm can then produce an accurate 3-D
model of the axon.
